I grew up in a small town in Oklahoma, Quapaw, Oklahoma.<br>
I remember getting my first transistor radio... must have been around 13 yrs old.<br>
My favorite all time band was the Beatles. And, did things ever change. Yes, Neil Young, The Zombies, The Animals and oh so many more suddenly flooded my brain with new music...<br>
I learned how to play guitar when I was going on 16...<br>
From that point to this point seems like ancient history on one side of the coin, but, it flew by quickly.<br>
I'm not your average music person.<br>
Sometimes, after I've recorded parts and put them together as a song, I have no idea how it happen. All I know, it happens.<br>
Most important advice I have is...<br>
don't put the guitar down no matter what...<br>
